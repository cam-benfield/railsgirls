# README

This app is an exploration of Rails and what it can do in its current iteration. I used SQLite3, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Carrierwave, and a few other gems to create this. It was largely inspired by a [Railsgirls](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install) tutorial I found while researching my other projects.
